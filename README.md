# ExtHanger
A unpatched version of LTMEAT. may not work on all devices. worth a try tho.
intructions for dummies: 
1. Deploying maincontent.html.


   first click launcher on your keyboard. (Search icon)
   then type in: "Text".
   after opening the app, return to the repo and copy EVERYTHING in maincontent.html.
   navigate back to text and paste the code in to the console.
   after doing that click: "Save As ...".
   then name the file "ExtHanger.html" (The .html is very important).
   go to chrome and and open files.
   then open the file you created.
   follow the instructions on-screen.
   NOTE: If "Text" does not appear just download it from the play store. IT WILL NOT BE BLOCKED!!!
